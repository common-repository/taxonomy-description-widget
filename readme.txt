== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My description isn't showing! =
* First of all, that's not a question.

* Does your post have a category (or other taxonomy term) selected? (I'm not trying to be condescendingâ€¦I just want to cover all the bases.) 

* Does your category (or other taxonomy term) have a description?  Go to your taxonomy term page and add a description.

* Is the appropriate taxonomy selected on the widget configuration?  Go to the widgets page and select the taxonomies you want to show.  (Hold ctr/cmd or shift for multiple selections)
